# Week 21: Makefile

Welcome to this weekâ€™s session! In Week 21, weâ€™ll be learning about **Makefiles**â€”a powerful tool that automates the build process for projects. Understanding Makefiles is essential for managing larger projects, compiling code efficiently, and handling dependencies automatically.

## ðŸ“– Overview

In Week 21, we will explore **Makefiles** in depth. A Makefile is used to control the build process of a project. It contains rules and dependencies to automatically compile and link the program, making it easier to manage complex projects.

### Topics

1. **Introduction to Makefile:**
   - What is a Makefile?
   - Basic Structure of a Makefile
   - Syntax of Makefiles
   - Writing Simple Makefiles

2. **Rules and Targets:**
   - Understanding Targets, Dependencies, and Commands
   - Writing Custom Rules
   - Using Variables in Makefiles

3. **Advanced Features:**
   - Conditional Statements in Makefiles
   - Functions in Makefiles (e.g., `$(wildcard)`, `$(foreach)`)
   - Using Makefile for Cross-Compilation

4. **Makefile for C Projects:**
   - Compiling C Source Code with Make
   - Linking Multiple Object Files
   - Creating Libraries
   - Managing Dependencies

5. **Optimizing Makefile:**
   - Incremental Builds: Rebuilding Only Whatâ€™s Necessary
   - Using `make clean` to Remove Intermediate Files
   - Managing Debug and Release Configurations
