# Week 32: UART Communication

This week focuses on **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)**, a widely used serial communication protocol. You will learn how to configure and use UART for data transmission between devices.

## üìñ Overview

This week covers the fundamentals of UART, including its working principles, configuration, and practical applications. You will also explore how to implement UART communication in embedded systems.

### Topics

1. **Introduction to UART:**
   - What is UART?
   - UART Frame Structure (Start Bit, Data Bits, Parity Bit, Stop Bit)
   - Baud Rate and Clock Synchronization

2. **UART Configuration:**
   - UART Registers and Modes
   - Polling vs Interrupt-Based UART
   - Error Detection and Handling

3. **UART Applications:**
   - Serial Communication Between Microcontrollers
   - Interfacing with Sensors and Peripherals
   - Debugging and Data Logging
