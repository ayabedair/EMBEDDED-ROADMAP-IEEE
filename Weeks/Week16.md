# Week 16: Advanced Project - Real-Life Payment Application

Welcome to this week‚Äôs project! This week, we‚Äôll be developing the project we have worked on before, but now with more knowledge and closer to real-life scenarios. We will be applying the concepts and techniques we've learned, refining the previous project with more advanced features, and improving the overall functionality.

## üîç Project Overview

A **Payment Application** is a software system designed to handle financial transactions, allowing users to send and receive payments electronically. This project will include features like transaction recording, user account management, and data storage using files.

### Features:
1. **Dynamic Data Management**:  
   - Use **Linked Lists** to store user accounts and transaction history dynamically. This approach allows flexibility in handling an unknown number of users or transactions.

2. **Data Persistence**:  
   - Store user account information and transaction history in files (e.g., `.txt` or `.dat` files) for retrieval even after the program ends.  

3. **Functions for Modularity**:  
   - Break the application into modular functions, such as:
     - `createAccount()` for adding a new user.
     - `processTransaction()` for handling payments.
     - `displayTransactions()` to show all transactions.
     - `saveDataToFile()` for saving data to a file.
     - `loadDataFromFile()` for loading data when the program starts.

## üìñ Implementation Details

### 1. **Linked Lists for Dynamic Storage**
   - Use a linked list to represent:
     - **User Accounts**: Each node contains user information like `name`, `ID`, `balance`, and a pointer to the next user.
     - **Transactions**: Each node contains transaction details like `sender`, `receiver`, `amount`, and a pointer to the next transaction.

### 2. **File Handling for Data Persistence**
   - Use **file I/O** functions in C (`fopen`, `fwrite`, `fread`, `fclose`) to save and retrieve data.
   - Suggested file structure:
     - A **users file** (e.g., `users.txt`) to store account details.
     - A **transactions file** (e.g., `transactions.txt`) to store all transaction history.

### 3. **Suggested Functions**
   Here are some modular functions you can implement:

   - **User Account Management**:
     ```c
     void createAccount();         // Create a new user account
     void viewAccounts();          // Display all user accounts
     void deleteAccount();         // Remove a user account
     ```

   - **Transactions**:
     ```c
     void processTransaction();    // Handle a transaction between users
     void displayTransactions();   // Display all transaction history
     ```

   - **File Operations**:
     ```c
     void saveDataToFile();        // Save linked list data to a file
     void loadDataFromFile();      // Load data from a file to the linked list
     ```

   - **Helper Functions**:
     ```c
     struct User* findUser();      // Find a user in the linked list
     ```

## üí° Additional Ideas to Enhance the Project

1. **Validation & Error Handling**:
   - Ensure user inputs are valid (e.g., check for negative transaction amounts).
   - Handle errors such as insufficient balance or duplicate accounts.

2. **User-Friendly Design**:
   - Use clear prompts and menus.
   - Add confirmation messages for critical actions like deleting accounts or processing transactions.

3. **Advanced Features (Optional)**:
   - Add **password protection** for user accounts.
   - Implement **sorting** or **searching** functionalities for better navigation of accounts and transactions.
   - Create a **summary report** showing total transactions, total users, etc.
