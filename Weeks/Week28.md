# Week 28: PORT, Keypad, and EXTI Drivers

This week focuses on **PORT Drivers**, **Keypad Interfacing**, and **External Interrupt (EXTI) Drivers**. You will learn how to interface with keypads, handle external interrupts, and develop drivers for these peripherals.

## üìñ Overview

This week covers the fundamentals of PORT configuration, keypad interfacing, and external interrupt handling. You will also explore how to write drivers for keypads and EXTI, enabling efficient input handling in embedded systems.

### Topics

1. **PORT Drivers:**
   - PORT Configuration and Initialization
   - Input and Output Modes
   - Pull-Up and Pull-Down Resistors

2. **Keypad Interfacing:**
   - Keypad Matrix Structure
   - Scanning Techniques (Row-Column Scanning)
   - Keypad Driver Development

3. **External Interrupt (EXTI) Drivers:**
   - What is an External Interrupt?
   - EXTI Configuration and Initialization
   - Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs)
   - Handling Multiple Interrupts
