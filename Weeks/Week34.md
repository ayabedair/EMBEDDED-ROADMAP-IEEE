# Week 34: I2C Communication

This week focuses on **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)**, a widely used synchronous serial communication protocol for connecting low-speed devices. You will learn how to configure and use I2C in embedded systems.

## üìñ Overview

This week covers the fundamentals of I2C, including its working principles, configuration, and practical applications. You will also explore how to implement I2C communication for interfacing with sensors and peripherals.

### Topics

1. **Introduction to I2C:**
   - What is I2C?
   - I2C Bus Architecture (Master-Slave Configuration)
   - I2C Signals (SDA, SCL)
   - Addressing and Data Frame Format

2. **I2C Configuration:**
   - I2C Registers and Modes
   - Clock Speed and Timing
   - Acknowledgment and Error Handling

3. **I2C Applications:**
   - Interfacing with Sensors, EEPROM, and Displays
   - Multi-Master and Multi-Slave Communication
   - Low-Speed Data Transfer
