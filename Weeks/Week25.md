# Week 25: GPIO and On-Chip Peripherals

This week focuses on **GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output)** and **On-Chip vs Off-Chip Peripherals**. You will learn about GPIO internal structure, input/output modes, and how to interface with peripherals like LEDs and seven-segment displays.

## üìñ Overview

This week covers the fundamentals of GPIO, including its internal structure, modes, and interfacing techniques. You will also explore layered architecture for bare-metal software development and practical examples using ATMega32 and STM32F103C6.

### Topics

1. **On-Chip vs Off-Chip Peripherals:**
   - Differences and Use Cases

2. **GPIO - DIO Peripheral:**
   - GPIO Internal Structure
   - Tristate Buffer
   - Output and Input Buffer Circuits

3. **Input & Output Modes:**
   - Output Pin Modes:
     - Push-Pull
     - Open Drain
   - Source and Sink Currents
   - Configurable High Voltage
   - Open Drain Bus (AND Wired)
   - Input Pin Modes:
     - Pull-Up & Pull-Down
     - Floating
     - Analog
     - Alternate Function (AF)

4. **GPIO for ATMega32 and STM32F103C6:**
   - DIO for ATMega32
   - GPIO/DIO Driver for ATMega32

5. **Interfacing and Practical Examples:**
   - LED Interfacing (Sink & Source Connections, Active LOW & HIGH)
   - DC Characteristics (I/O Voltage Levels)
   - AMR (Absolute Maximum Ratings)
   - Seven-Segment Display Interfacing

6. **Software Architecture:**
   - Review: Bitwise Operators, File Guards, Volatile Keyword
   - Layered Architecture for Bare-Metal Software
