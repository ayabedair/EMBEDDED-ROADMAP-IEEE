# Week 22: Embedded System Concepts

Welcome to this week! In this task, we will explore **Embedded System Concepts**, covering the fundamental principles and components that define embedded systems. These concepts are crucial for understanding how embedded systems are designed and implemented.

## ðŸ“– Overview

In Week 22, we will dive into the core concepts of embedded systems, including their architecture, memory types, processor components, and more. These topics will help you build a strong foundation for working with embedded systems.

### Topics

1. **Embedded Systems Basics:**
   - Definitions and Introduction to Embedded Systems
   - System Board and System on Chip (SoC)
   - IC Types: MPU, MCU, GPU, DSP, SoC, ECU

2. **Processor Components:**
   - Instruction Decoder (Hardwired & Memory Mapped)
   - Instruction Life Cycle
   - RISC vs CISC Architectures
   - Register Files (GPR & SPR)

3. **Memory Types:**
   - Basic Memory Element: Flip Flop
   - Volatile Memory: RAM (SRAM vs DRAM)
   - Non-Volatile Memory: ROM (Mask Programmable ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, FLASH)
   - Hybrid Memory and NVRAM
