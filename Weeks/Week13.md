# Week 13: Linked List

Welcome to Week 13 of the IEEE Student Activity! This week, we'll be focusing on learning about **Linked Lists**. Linked lists are fundamental data structures used in computer science and are crucial for understanding more complex data structures and algorithms.

## 📖 Overview

In Week 13, our focus is on **Linked Lists**. We will cover their implementation, operations, and applications.

### Topics

1. **Introduction to Linked Lists:**
   - What is a Linked List?
   - Types of Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

2. **Basic Operations:**
   - Insertion
   - Deletion
   - Traversal

3. **Advanced Operations:**
   - Reversing a Linked List
   - Detecting and Removing Cycles
   - Merging Two Linked Lists

4. **Applications:**
   - Real-world use cases of Linked Lists
