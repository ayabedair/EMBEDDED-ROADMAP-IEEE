# Week 30: Timers

This week focuses on **Timers**, their configurations, and applications in embedded systems. You will learn how to use timers for tasks like time measurement, PWM generation, and event scheduling.

## üìñ Overview

This week covers the fundamentals of timers, including their working principles, modes, and practical applications. You will also explore how to configure and use timers in microcontrollers.

### Topics

1. **Introduction to Timers:**
   - What is a Timer?
   - Timer Registers and Modes
   - Prescalers and Clock Sources

2. **Timer Modes:**
   - Normal Mode
   - CTC (Clear Timer on Compare Match) Mode
   - Fast PWM Mode
   - Phase Correct PWM Mode

3. **Timer Applications:**
   - Time Measurement and Delay Generation
   - Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
   - Event Scheduling and Interrupts

4. **Practical Examples:**
   - Configuring Timers in Microcontrollers (e.g., ATMega32, STM32)
   - Generating PWM Signals for Motor Control
   - Implementing Delays and Timeouts
