# IEEE Student Activity Week 17: Queue Content

Welcome to Week 17 of the IEEE Student Activity! This week, we'll be diving into the topic of queues. We have curated a set of educational videos to help you grasp the concepts effectively.

## Task Overview
1. **Study Videos**: Watch videos 11, 12 and 16 from the provided his [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEBRPBUkZ4mb6lVqSLRQ7mvSFRcoR7-XV). These videos will provide you with a solid understanding of the queue data structure and its implementation.
2. **Implement Code for Stack**: After studying the videos, your task is to implement code for a queue data structure. You can choose your preferred programming language for this task.

## Resources
- [Data Structures In C](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEBRPBUkZ4mb6lVqSLRQ7mvSFRcoR7-XV): This playlist contains educational videos about data structure in C.

## Guidelines for Task Completion
1. **Study Videos Thoroughly**: Take your time to understand the concepts presented in videos 10 and 11. Pay attention to the explanations and examples provided.
2. **Implementing the Queue**: Once you have a good grasp of the concepts, proceed to implement a queue data structure in your chosen programming language. Make sure to handle enqueue, dequeue, and other necessary operations correctly.
3. **Testing**: After implementation, test your queue implementation with various test cases to ensure its correctness and efficiency.

## Submission
- Submit your implementation of the queue data structure to the designated platform or person handling submissions.
