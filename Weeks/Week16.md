# IEEE Student Activity: Week 16 - Stack Content

Welcome to Week 16 of the IEEE Student Activity! This week, we'll be diving into the fascinating world of stacks. Stacks are a fundamental data structure widely used in computer science and software engineering.

## Task Overview:

1. **Watch Videos**: 
   - To get started, watch this playlist [Stacks | Chapter-6 | Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRgWh1emltdMOz8O2m5X3YYn). These videos will provide you with a solid understanding of stacks, their operations, and implementations.

2. **Implement Code for Stack**:
   - After familiarizing yourself with the concepts through the videos, it's time to get hands-on experience. Implement a stack data structure in the programming language of your choice. You can choose any language you are comfortable with, such as Python, Java, C++, etc. Make sure to include operations like push, pop, peek, isEmpty, and any additional methods you find relevant.

## Submission:
- Once you have completed both tasks, submit your implementation along with any additional documentation or explanations you find necessary. You can submit your work through the designated platform or channel provided by your IEEE Student Activity organizer.
