# Week 23: Advanced Embedded System Concepts

Welcome to this week! In this task, we will explore **Advanced Embedded System Concepts**, diving deeper into microcontroller architecture, memory systems, and interfacing. These concepts are essential for understanding how embedded systems operate at a lower level.

## ðŸ“– Overview

In Week 23, we will focus on advanced topics such as cache memory, MCU architecture, memory mapping, and bus interfacing. These concepts will help you gain a deeper understanding of how microcontrollers are designed and how they interact with memory and peripherals.

### Topics

1. **Memory Systems:**
   - Cache Memory
   - Memory Mapping (Base Address & Offset)
   - Memory-Mapped vs Port-Mapped I/O

2. **Microcontroller Architecture:**
   - MCU Architecture (Von Neumann vs Harvard)
   - MCU Clock Systems
   - FPU, MPU, and MMU

3. **Interfacing and Communication:**
   - MCU Bus Interfacing
   - Bus Bridges
   - AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture)
   - MCU Ports (Master & Slave)
   - Transactions

4. **Technical Reference Manual (TRM):**
   - Reading and Understanding TRM
