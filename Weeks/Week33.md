# Week 33: SPI Communication

This week focuses on **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)**, a synchronous serial communication protocol widely used for high-speed data transfer between devices. You will learn how to configure and use SPI in embedded systems.

## üìñ Overview

This week covers the fundamentals of SPI, including its working principles, configuration, and practical applications. You will also explore how to implement SPI communication for interfacing with peripherals.

### Topics

1. **Introduction to SPI:**
   - What is SPI?
   - SPI Bus Architecture (Master-Slave Configuration)
   - SPI Signals (MOSI, MISO, SCK, SS)

2. **SPI Configuration:**
   - SPI Registers and Modes
   - Clock Polarity and Phase (CPOL and CPHA)
   - Data Frame Format and Speed

3. **SPI Applications:**
   - Interfacing with Sensors, Displays, and Memory Devices
   - Multi-Slave Communication
   - High-Speed Data Transfer

4. **Practical Examples:**
   - Configuring SPI in Microcontrollers (e.g., ATMega32, STM32)
   - Implementing SPI Communication with Peripherals
