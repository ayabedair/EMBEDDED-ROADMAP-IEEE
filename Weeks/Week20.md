# Week 20: Startup Code and Linker Script

Welcome to this weekâ€™s session! In this task, we will explore the **Startup Code** and **Linker Scripts** used in system-level programming. These concepts are fundamental to understanding how low-level code is organized and executed, especially in embedded systems.

## ðŸ“– Overview

In Week 20, we will dive into the **Startup Code**, which is crucial for initializing the system when it first powers up, and **Linker Scripts**, which define how memory is allocated and how different parts of the program are linked together.

### Topics

1. **Startup Code:**
   - Purpose and Function of Startup Code
   - Initializing Registers, Stack, and Heap
   - Reset Handlers and System Setup
   - Transition to Main Program

2. **Linker Script:**
   - Overview of Linker Scripts
   - Memory Layout: Text, Data, BSS Sections
   - Defining and Organizing Sections
   - Customizing the Linker Script for Embedded Systems
