# Week 14: Stack

Welcome to Week 14 of the IEEE Student Activity! This week, we'll be focusing on learning about **Stacks**. Stacks are an essential data structure in computer science and are widely used in algorithms, memory management, and more.

## üìñ Overview

In Week 14, our focus is on **Stacks**. We will cover their implementation, operations, and applications.

### Topics

1. **Introduction to Stacks:**
   - What is a Stack?
   - LIFO (Last In, First Out) Principle
   - Real-world Examples of Stacks

2. **Basic Operations:**
   - Push (Insert)
   - Pop (Remove)
   - Peek (Top Element)

3. **Advanced Concepts:**
   - Stack Implementation (Array vs. Linked List)
   - Stack Overflow and Underflow

4. **Applications:**
   - Parentheses Matching
   - Infix to Postfix Conversion
   - Evaluating Postfix Expressions

## üìö Resources

1. [Data Structures In Arabic Using C](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEBRPBUkZ4mb6lVqSLRQ7mvSFRcoR7-XV) videos from 2 to 8

## üìù Task

1. **Implement Stack Code:**
   - Write code for a stack in C. Focus on implementing key operations like push, pop, and peek. Use the concepts from the videos and additional resources as references.
2. **Implementation of Infix-to-Postfix and Postfix-to-Infix Conversions**
3. **Check for additional tasks or quizes**
