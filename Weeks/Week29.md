# Week 29: Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)

This week focuses on **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** concepts, configuration, and driver development. You will learn how to interface with ADCs, read analog signals, and process sensor data in embedded systems.

## üìñ Overview

This week covers the fundamentals of ADC, including its working principles, configuration, and practical implementation. You will also explore how to write ADC drivers and process analog data from sensors.

### Topics

1. **Introduction to ADC:**
   - What is an ADC?
   - ADC Resolution and Sampling Rate
   - Reference Voltage and Input Channels

2. **ADC Configuration:**
   - ADC Initialization and Setup
   - Single-Channel vs Multi-Channel Mode
   - Polling vs Interrupt-Based ADC

3. **ADC Driver Development:**
   - Writing an ADC Driver
   - Reading and Processing Analog Data
   - Calibration and Error Handling
