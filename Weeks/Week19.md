# Week 19: Booting Sequence and System Startup

Welcome to this weekâ€™s session! In this weekâ€™s task, we will dive into the **Booting Sequence** and explore the key concepts related to system startup, including **Running Modes**, the **Bootloader**, and **Startup Code**.

## ðŸ“– Overview

In Week 19, our focus is on understanding the **Booting Sequence** in embedded systems and how a system transitions from powering up to being fully operational. We will also cover the different **Running Modes** and compare the roles of the **Bootloader** and **Startup Code**.

### Topics

1. **Booting Sequence:**
   - Overview of the Boot Process
   - Initial Power-On State
   - BIOS/UEFI Role in the Boot Sequence
   - System Initialization

2. **Running Modes:**
   - **ROM Mode:**
     - Characteristics of ROM Mode
     - How ROM Mode works during booting
   - **RAM Mode:**
     - Transition from ROM Mode to RAM Mode
     - Role of RAM in system operation

3. **Bootloader vs Startup Code:**
   - **Bootloader:**
     - Purpose and Function of a Bootloader
     - How the Bootloader Loads the Operating System
   - **Startup Code:**
     - Role of Startup Code in Setting Up the System
     - Initializing CPU and Hardware Configuration
