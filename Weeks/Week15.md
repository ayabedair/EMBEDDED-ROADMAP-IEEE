# Week 16: Queue

Welcome to Week 16 of the IEEE Student Activity! This week, we'll be focusing on learning about **Queues**. Queues are one of the fundamental data structures in computer science and are widely used in various applications, including scheduling, buffering, and more.

## üìñ Overview

In Week 16, our focus is on **Queues**. We will cover their implementation, operations, types, and applications.

### Topics

1. **Introduction to Queues:**
   - What is a Queue?
   - FIFO (First In, First Out) Principle
   - Real-world Examples of Queues

2. **Basic Operations:**
   - Enqueue (Insert)
   - Dequeue (Remove)
   - Peek (Front Element)

3. **Applications:**
   - Task Scheduling
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Cache Management
   - Data Buffering

## üìù Task

1. **Implement Queue Code:**
   - Write code for a queue in C. Start with simple operations like enqueue, dequeue, and peek. Explore implementing advanced types like circular queues or priority queues.
2. **Check for additional tasks or quizes**
