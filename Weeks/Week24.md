# Week 24: MCU Clocks and Interrupts

In this week, we will explore **MCU Clocks** and **Interrupts**, which are critical for understanding how microcontrollers manage timing and respond to events. These concepts are essential for building efficient and responsive embedded systems.

## üìñ Overview

This week focuses on **Clock Management**, **Interrupt Systems**, and their implementation in microcontrollers. You will learn about clock trees, interrupt handling, and the trade-offs between polling and interrupts.

### Topics

1. **MCU Clocks:**
   - Clock Management Unit (CMU)
   - Clock Tree (Understanding via TRM & Cube IDE)
   - Examples:
     - STM32F103C6 (RCC)
     - TIVA-C (System Control)

2. **MCU Interrupts:**
   - What is an Interrupt?
   - GIC/PIC (General/Programmable Interrupt Controller) with Examples
   - AFIO (Alternate Function I/O)
   - Concepts: Determinism and Responsiveness
   - Super Loop System vs Foreground/Background System
   - Polling vs Interrupts

3. **Interrupt Servicing:**
   - Vector Table-Based (Fixed Priority)
   - Non-Vector Table-Based (Flexible Priority)
   - Static and Dynamic Vector Tables
   - Vector Table Location (FLASH or RAM) and Initialization (Startup Code/Burner)

4. **Advanced Interrupt Concepts:**
   - Interrupt Nesting and Types
   - Flag Clearance
   - Instruction Cycle with Interrupt
   - Function Calling vs Software Interrupts
   - Hardware Interrupts vs Software Interrupts
   - Asynchronous vs Synchronous Interrupts
   - Sequential & Nested Interrupts
   - Interrupt Overload/Overhead
