# Week 17: Preprocessor Directives in C

Welcome to this week‚Äôs session! In this week‚Äôs task, we‚Äôll dive into the world of **Preprocessor Directives** in C programming. The preprocessor plays a key role in making your code more efficient, readable, and easier to maintain.

## üìñ Overview

In Week 18, our focus is on understanding the power of **Preprocessor Directives** in C programming. Preprocessor directives are instructions that are processed by the C preprocessor before the actual compilation of the program begins.

### Topics

1. **Macro Definitions:**
   - Defining Constants with `#define`
   - Using Macros for Code Reusability

2. **Conditional Compilation:**
   - Using `#if`, `#else`, `#elif`, and `#endif`
   - Conditional Compilation for Debugging

3. **File Inclusion:**
   - Using `#include` to Include Header Files
   - Creating Custom Header Files

4. **Other Preprocessor Directives:**
   - `#undef`: Undefined a Macro
   - `#pragma`: Using Compiler-Specific Directives

5. **Advanced Preprocessor Directives:**
   - Macro Functions and Their Benefits
   - File Guards and Avoiding Multiple Inclusions
