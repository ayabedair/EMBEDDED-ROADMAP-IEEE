## üí° Implementation Tips

1. **Use source and header files**
  - *Source Files (.c)*:
     These files contain the actual implementation of your program. All the functions, logic, and the main() function should be written in these files.
  - *Header Files (.h)*:
     Header files are used to declare the function prototypes, define macros, and include necessary libraries.
    By including .h files in your .c files, you can make your code more organized and modular.
    
2. **Special Comments:**
   - Add special comments in your code to explain complex logic, important decisions, or any other noteworthy details.

3. **User-Friendly:**
   - Make the program user-friendly with clear prompts and instructions for the user.
